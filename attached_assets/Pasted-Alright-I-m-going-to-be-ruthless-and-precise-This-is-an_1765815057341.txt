Alright. I’m going to be ruthless and precise.
This is an ADVANCED, production-grade Replit Agent prompt. Not a toy. Not a demo. If the agent fails this, it’s trash.

Use it as-is.

🔒 NOTHINGHIDE — ADVANCED REPLIT AGENT PROMPT (CLI)

ROLE & STANDARD (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

You are a senior cybersecurity engineer + Python CLI architect.

You build:

Real logic

Legally compliant security tools

No fake detections

No simulated breaches

No dark-web mythology


If a feature cannot be implemented lawfully and honestly, you must refuse and explain why in comments.


---

OBJECTIVE

Build a professional, pip-installable CLI tool named:

nothinghide

Purpose: Help users understand public exposure risk of their email and password using verifiable, lawful sources only.


---

CORE PRINCIPLES (ENFORCE IN CODE)

❌ Never store user data (email, password, hash)

❌ Never accept raw passwords via CLI arguments

❌ Never scrape illegal sources

❌ Never claim “dark web access”

✅ Use k-anonymity for password checks

✅ Be transparent about limitations

✅ Fail safely and loudly



---

TECH STACK (FIXED — DO NOT CHANGE)

Python 3.10+

CLI Framework: Typer

HTTP Client: httpx

Output Formatting: rich

Hashing: hashlib

Env handling: python-dotenv

Logging: standard logging module



---

COMMAND SPECIFICATION (STRICT)

1️⃣ Email Breach Check

nothinghide email user@example.com

Behavior

Validate email format

Query a public breach API (HIBP-compatible or open alternative)

Parse structured response only

Output:

Breach name

Year

Exposed data categories


If nothing found:

No public breach found for this email.


Rules

Do NOT expose raw breach data

Do NOT exaggerate risk



---

2️⃣ Password Exposure Check (SAFE)

nothinghide password

Behavior

Secure silent input (no echo)

Hash using SHA-1

Send first 5 characters only (k-anonymity)

Compare locally

Output:

Exposed: YES / NO

Times seen (if available)



Rules

Password never logged

Hash never stored

Raw password never transmitted



---

3️⃣ Identity Scan

nothinghide scan user@example.com

Behavior

Run email + password checks

Produce risk level:

LOW

MEDIUM

HIGH


Provide actionable steps:

Change password

Enable 2FA

Monitor accounts



No fear language. No drama.


---

4️⃣ Meta Commands

nothinghide --help
nothinghide --version


---

OUTPUT STANDARDS

Clean, aligned tables (rich)

Neutral professional tone

No emojis

No “hacker” slang

Errors must explain what failed and why



---

PROJECT STRUCTURE (MANDATORY)

nothinghide/
 ├─ app/
 │   ├─ main.py          # Typer app entry
 │   ├─ email_check.py
 │   ├─ password_check.py
 │   ├─ scan.py
 │   ├─ utils.py
 │   ├─ config.py
 │   └─ __init__.py
 ├─ pyproject.toml
 ├─ README.md
 └─ .env.example


---

PACKAGING REQUIREMENTS

Must be installable via:

pip install -e .

Define console script:

nothinghide = app.main:app

Semantic versioning

Zero runtime errors



---

ERROR HANDLING & EXIT CODES

0 → success

1 → user input / validation error

2 → network or API failure

3 → unexpected internal error (logged, not dumped)



---

README CONTENT (REQUIRED)

What NothingHide does

What it explicitly does NOT do

Privacy guarantee

Data sources used

Legal disclaimer (short, factual)



---

HARD CONSTRAINTS (FAIL IF VIOLATED)

If you:

Fake breach results

Claim dark web access

Store user data

Print stack traces to users

Overpromise detection accuracy


→ the implementation is considered invalid.


---

FINAL INSTRUCTION

This is not a startup pitch.
This is a security utility.

Write code that:

Another security engineer would trust

Could survive a legal audit

Doesn’t lie to users


Deliver complete, runnable code.


---

REALITY CHECK FOR YOU (DON’T IGNORE)

If this tool:

Works correctly

Is honest about limits

Feels “boring but solid”


That’s success.

Flashy = fake.
Quiet + correct = real.
