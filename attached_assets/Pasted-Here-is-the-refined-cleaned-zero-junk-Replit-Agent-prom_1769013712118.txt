Here is the refined, cleaned, zero-junk Replit Agent prompt.
No motivational talk. No AI hype. No questions. No filler.
Just a hard spec that either works or fails.

🔒 REPLIT AGENT PROMPT — NothingHide (Strict, Legal, Real)

Role

Senior cybersecurity engineer and full-stack architect.
Build only systems that are technically honest, legally compliant, and auditable.
No simulated hacking. No fabricated intelligence. No unverifiable claims.


---

🧠 Project Definition

Name: NothingHide
Domain: Cybersecurity / Digital Identity Exposure
Purpose:
Identify where a user’s digital identity is publicly exposed or at risk using only lawful, open, and verifiable methods.

The system must never claim access to private, restricted, leaked, or illegal data.


---

🎯 Core Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

No dark web access

No password collection or processing

No private or leaked databases

No fake “real-time” scans

No AI claims without deterministic logic


Allowed:

Public APIs

Open datasets

Lawful scraping of publicly accessible pages

Explicit limitation disclosure

Risk estimation, not certainty


If something cannot be checked legally, state it clearly in the output.


---

🏗️ System Architecture

1️⃣ Input Classification — NH-Signal

Accept inputs:

Email

Username

Image URL


Validate format.
Reject unsafe or unsupported input.
Classify input type with confidence.

Output

{
  "type": "email | username | image",
  "confidence": 0.00
}


---

2️⃣ Orchestration Engine — NH-Chain

Select modules based on input type.
Execute real backend logic sequentially or in parallel.
Stream progress events to frontend using SSE or WebSockets.

Example Chain Events

[
  "Input classified as email",
  "Querying public breach indexes",
  "Evaluating reuse indicators",
  "Aggregating exposure signals"
]

No artificial delays.
Every event must correspond to actual processing.


---

3️⃣ Exposure Intelligence Modules

🔹 Breach Intelligence — NH-Breach

Use only open breach datasets or legally permitted APIs

Never store raw personal data

Return metadata only


Output

{
  "found": true,
  "sources": ["Public Dataset A"],
  "severity": "high"
}


---

🔹 Identity Correlation — NH-Correlate

Check username reuse across public platforms

Use availability checks and similarity heuristics

No login-gated or private scraping


Output

{
  "matches": ["github", "instagram"],
  "risk": "medium"
}


---

🔹 Media Exposure Risk — NH-FaceRisk

Generate perceptual hashes

Use lawful reverse-image or similarity APIs

Assess exposure risk only


Mandatory disclaimer in output:

> “This does not confirm misuse. It estimates public exposure risk.”




---

4️⃣ Verdict Engine — NH-Verdict

Aggregate all signals into:

Exposure score (0–100)

Risk level: Low / Medium / High

Plain-language explanation


No technical jargon in final output.


---

5️⃣ Guidance System — NH-Response

Generate prioritized, actionable steps:

Account security

Privacy tightening

Platform-specific actions


Example

1. Change passwords


2. Enable two-factor authentication


3. Report impersonation


4. Restrict profile visibility




---

6️⃣ Transparency Layer — NH-Explain

Every result must include:

What was checked

What was not checked

Data sources used

Legal scope statement


Mandatory Statement

> “NothingHide analyzes only publicly accessible information.
No private systems or restricted data were accessed.”




---

🎨 Frontend Requirements

Single-page application

Minimal, neutral design (no hacker visuals)

One input field

Real-time chain feed

No fake terminals or animations



---

🧪 Demo Mode

Explicit demo toggle

Clearly labeled “Demo Data”

Demo data must never mix with real scans



---

🧯 Legal & Ethical Guardrails

Display permanently:

> “NothingHide does not access the dark web, private databases, or confidential systems.
This tool provides exposure awareness, not forensic proof.”



Fail the build if any module violates this.


---

🛠️ Implementation Notes

Backend: Node.js or Python

Frontend: Vanilla JS or React

Streaming: SSE or WebSockets

Storage: Minimal, ephemeral only

Logging: Privacy-safe, non-identifying



---

✅ Objective

Deliver an MVP that:

Works without deception

Explains its limits clearly

Respects the law

Builds trust through transparency


If a feature cannot be implemented legally, explain the limitation instead of simulating it.

This spec is not flexible.
If something feels impressive but isn’t real, it doesn’t belong here.
